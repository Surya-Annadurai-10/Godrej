                Godrej was founded in 1897 by Ardeshir Godrej to help build economic independence for India. We contributed towards this purpose by both innovating and actively donating a significant portion of the Group's profits to India's freedom movement. During the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, we pioneered the first commercially made soap in the world from vegetable oil and without animal fat. In 1951, we crafted the ballot boxes for free India's first general election, an election where India gave both women and men the equal right to vote.
